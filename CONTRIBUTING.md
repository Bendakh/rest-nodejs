# Contributing

We would love to have our contribute, thank you for that! ðŸŽ‰

If you want to add missing APIs, or correct an issue, you will have to follow this list of instructions.

## Instructions

1. Set up your local environment by forking the repository.
2. When you are about to commit, [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is running to check if your commit message respects [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
3. Write tests, there is a high coverage on the repository. Simply run `npm run test:cov` to generate a `coverage/` directory.
4. Respect coding style: We use [eslint](https://eslintjs.com) for coding guidelines. Run `npm run lint` to check if there are errors.
5. Open a Pull Request where you describe the feature/issue you are about to publish.
